# 🛠️ debug-journal

**A dev's survival log — real bugs, real fixes, no StackOverflow hunting next time.**

This is my personal collection of real-world development problems I faced and exactly how I fixed them.  
Each issue is documented clearly with:

- 💥 **Problem** — what went wrong  
- 🧠 **Fix** — exact commands/configs that worked  
- 🧹 **Cleanup** — anything I had to undo or reset  
- 📚 **Learned** — what I understood from the issue

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

Sometimes it’s hard to remember:
- That one weird Git remote fix...
- The commands which has special keys in it...
- Or why VS Code’s terminal broke again...

This repo saves me time. It helps me avoid repeating mistakes.  
And maybe someday, it helps someone else too.

## ✍️ How I Use This

Whenever I hit an issue while coding:

1. I create a new `.md` file with a clear name like `npm-package-env-error.md`
2. I write what happened, what fixed it, and what I learned
3. I add a link to this file in the table above ☝️

Simple. Reusable. Mine.
